# Why I Made This ?

Yes, seriously. This was the best title I could think (at that time anyway)

## What is the point of this whole thing anyway ?

I guess the main reason was that I needed something to kill time and occupy myself with, which is really stupid considering I plan to crack India's most craziest exam after school. If you really have nothing else to do and/or am as bored as I am feel free to read my previous post, in which I rant about all of this (in part at least)

So I guess I am stupid after all

## Effort undertaken

I really am quite happy with how this thing looks, took quite some time to set it up to my personal liking, but I would say the satisfaction it gave me, but then again, I easily get bored with really anything and this will probably keep me occupied for a week tops.

Anyway, I didn't had to go to much trouble to set all of this up, but again that's also because I like to do this. Aaahhh idk

## Why do I change the look every so often?

tl;dr : I get bored

## Did I abandon this ?

This is here for two reasons

1. I wanted this post to be longer

2. I wanted to tell the people who are reading this (yeah I am optimistic too) if I had abandoned this

   So if the build status image, shows passing, this is still alive. If not then idk ![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/dopewind/dopewind.github.io.svg?branch=master)
